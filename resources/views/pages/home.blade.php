				<H1>Business Employment Incentive Program (BEIP)</H1>  

<p>In accordance with P.L. 2003, c.166, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA), 
submits this report detailing Fiscal Year 2013 activity for the Business Employment Incentive 
Program (BEIP).</p>
				
<p>As required by statute, the report includes the following: the number of BEIP agreements entered into by the State during FY2013 with a description of each; number of jobs created under each project; new income tax revenue received
from withholdings; the amounts awarded to each project as grants; and, an update on the status of projects under each agreement.</p>
			
<p>In September of 2013, Governor Chris Christiesigned New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, P.L. 2013, c. 161.  The Act streamlines New Jersey's five existing economic development incentive programs, including BEIP, into two;
the Grow New Jersey  Assistance (Grow NJ) Program will be the State's main job creation and retention incentive program and the Economic Redevelopment and Growth (ERG) program will be New Jersey's key developer incentive program.  In accordance with the Act and effective September 18, 2013, the EDA is no longer accepting applications for assistance under the BEIP program.</p> 
				
<p>All pending applications submitted for approval under this program were acted on by December 31, 2013.  Any existing BEIP requiring modification will be addressed through existing rules at NJAC 19:31-10.2.  As a result of the enhanced incentive programs available through the Economic Opportunity Act, some BEIP projects will be terminated in order to utilize the new incentive programs.</p>
				
<p>Pursuant to provisions in the Act, the EDA shall not enter into an incentive agreement with a business that has previously received incentives pursuant to the "Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Act," P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.), the "Business Employment Incentive Program Act," P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-124 et seq.), or any other program administered by EDA unless the business has satisfied all of its obligations underlying the previous award of incentives or is compliant with section 4 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-245) which provides that a business 
terminating an existing incentive agreement in order to participate in an incentive agreement pursuant to the P.L. 
	2013, 161, shall be subject to recapture calculated to recognize the period of time that the business was in compliance prior to termination.</p>
